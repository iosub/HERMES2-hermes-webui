# Hermes WebUI - Production Readiness Project

## Project

**Repo:** hermes-webui  
**Goal:** Apply production-readiness audit in small, safe, minimal patches

## Working Rules

- Work only inside this repo
- Keep patches minimal and localized
- Do not rewrite architecture
- Do not add unrelated cleanup
- One fix batch at a time
- After each batch, always report:
  1. Files changed
  2. Exact code changes
  3. Why the change fixes the issue
  4. Assumptions or remaining risks
  5. Manual test checklist
  6. Unified diff

## Completed

- [x] **Fix 3:** XSS hardening in chat rendering
- [x] **Fix 4:** Path traversal hardening for uploads
- [x] **Fix 1:** Create requirements.txt
- [x] **Fix 2:** Authentication

## Next

- [ ] **Phase 2:** Stability fixes

## Pending Queue
